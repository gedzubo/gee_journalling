# Journalling RoR Application

This is a "playground" RoR project to explore various new features of the framework or other cool libraries.

# Explore

- RoR built-in testing (https://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html). Recently, I discovered this idea that some people are using RoR built-in testing tools so they don't need to use any other 3rd party gems like Rspec. I am trying to explore what are the pros and cons of this approach over other common testing techniques.
- Action Text (https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_text_overview.html)
